    "# Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "a. You would likely want to use a containerization system to complete this project. The reason for this is that this code will be used as a generalized software for a bunch of different meals on wheels chapters. Thus, you need to make sure that you have containers for databases for these Meals on Wheels chapters. Furthermore, you would also want a container for the actual software itself (like the website/app that you create for these chapters). Therefore, you would definitely want a containerized system. The other three options would not work because none of them would be able to provide a continuous service like these meals on wheels chapters need for their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. For this case, we can simply use a virtual environment. It fits the situation perfectly. It is a one-off project that will not be used again. They only need the report, nothing else from this project (no code). All other options would be overkill due to the fact that they would allocate an excessive amount of resources in comparison to what is required for the project. Containers and virtual machines would allocate resources to instantiating another \"computer\", which is unnecessary. It would work, but it would be overkill. Using global variables would also be overkill because it's a one-off project. No need to ruin your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. Given that we need several open source image processing software packages that only work on Ubuntu Linux, we either need a virtual machine or a container. Because we are building a model, I would suggest a virtual machine. We can instantiate it to have the correct version of Linux and then we an build the model and save the outputs/model as needed. A container would likely work as well, but may be overkill given the resources it uses on your own machine. Furthermore, global and virtual environments would be not enough if you do not have Ubuntu Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. You would likely want a virtual environment for this project. The reason being you want to transition to Python 4 in the future, so there is no reason to change your global variables for this project. Furthermore, you could use a VM or a container, but they would be overkill, unless you have a very complex project."
